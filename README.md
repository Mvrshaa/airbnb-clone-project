# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web development initiative that simulates the creation of a real-world booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project focuses on backend system architecture, relational database design, secure API development, and CI/CD integration. It provides hands-on experience in building scalable, maintainable, and secure backend services, empowering learners to apply industry best practices in a collaborative development environment.

## Project Goals

* Develop a fully functional backend for an Airbnb-like platform.
* Design and implement a robust relational database schema.
* Build secure and scalable APIs using modern frameworks.
* Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
* Promote collaborative workflows through GitHub-based team development.
* Understand and apply backend security best practices.

## Tech Stack

* **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for rapid API development.
* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful open-source relational database system for managing structured data.
* **GraphQL**: A flexible query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
* **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across different environments.
* **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation tool used to streamline development workflows and deployments.
